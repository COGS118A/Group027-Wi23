    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to build a recommender system based on Amazon reviews of women’s clothing, specifically in the dress category. That is, to predict recommended products for a customer based on their shopping experience with Amazon dresses. We will collect our dataset from Amazon reviews to represent the customers’ shopping experience and preferences for clothing items. We will conduct natural language processing using the NLTK library on this dataset to analyze the contents of the reviews and extract the customers’ sentiments about the product. We will also be using multi-class classification with logistic regression to classify categories of women’s dresses based on various features in the reviews dataset. Due to the multitude of departments of dresses on Amazon, the One vs. Rest approach will be employed to predict specific categories based on the trends observed in customer reviews. The performance of our model will be evaluated through a confusion matrix to generate true and false predictions as well as through ROC curve and AUC, which will give us an overall picture of our classification success. This can be used to further modify the model if needed. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In a society where online shopping and ecommerce have become a new norm, especially after a global pandemic, creating the best experience for online shoppers has become increasingly important. According to an article by Forbes<a name=\"doty\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#dotynote), consumers heavily prefer  personalized advertisements that are tailored to their interests, and that “90% of consumers say that messages from companies that are not personally relevant to them are ‘annoying.’” This demonstrates not only the usefulness of personalized marketing but also the importance of accurate recommendation systems that do not erroneously recommend irrelevant products to consumers. It also makes ads more engaging and more likely to be interacted with, creating an overall improved experience for consumers. Many big tech companies make enormous profits by gathering and selling data based on users’ interests and shopping habits. By improving and effectively integrating a recommendation system into the online shopping process, Amazon has “reported a 29% sales increase to $12.83 billion during its second fiscal quarter,” illustrating how the improved shopping experience for customers directly translates to improved profits for an online seller. What kind of data are these online businesses and marketers using and how are they using it to create the most profitable targeted advertisements and recommendations to their shoppers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the obvious advantages of generating effective product recommendations, the importance of answering this question is clear, and much research has gone into the most successful and common ways to do this. According to this literature review of studies of recommendation systems <a name=\"portugal\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#portugalnote), a few of the most common machine learning algorithms studied to accomplish this task are clustering, decision trees, and regression. Additionally, the study details the importance of how a larger data set can improve the success of the system’s recommendations. These findings motivate how we identified the problem, as well as our proposed dataset and recommendation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce companies like Amazon use recommender systems to identify similar or complementary products that the user just bought or viewed to maximize the impulse buying phenomenon that occurs in their physical counterparts. The personalization of shopping online keeps customers engaged and offers products of interest to them that they may not even think about. There are three main types of recommendation systems: Collaborative filtering, Content-Based filtering, and Hybrid Recommendation systems<a name=\"maruti\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#marutinote). Collaborative filtering uses past user behavior to make recommendations while content-based filtering focuses on the attributes of the product content itself to make recommendations. Hybrid recommendation systems is a combination of using both types of filtering simultaneously to suggest a broader range of products for customers<a name=\"maruti\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#marutinote). As these recommendation systems not only help enhance user experience, but also increase sales, efficiency, and cost savings, it is important to build understanding about how recommender algorithms work to cluster products together and suggest them to a user based on their metadata to make further improvements at integration accurate recommendations into every step of the purchasing process.

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "While E-commerce has made shopping more accessible over the past decades, people have also noticed that many issues are arising with the limitation of the in-person experience. This is especially notable when shopping for women’s clothing. Shopping on online platforms such as Amazon for women’s clothing has always been a widely-studied topic because it is difficult to make recommendations with many different categories of clothing and range of users. Therefore, for this project, our team has decided to look into this problem by making clothing category predictions for users on Amazon. We will be implementing a logistic regression algorithm that predicts classes based on the One vs. Rest approach; in other words, 1 will be predicted if the category that the machine learning algorithm predicts matches one specific category that we choose and 0 if not (any other class). This will be computed for the different classes we choose to look at. For this algorithm, we will measure its overall performance by building a confusion matrix on the results from using the testing dataset. The confusion matrix will allow us to calculate various metrics that will be useful for assessing the model (see more on Evaluation Metrics). In addition to having the steps be clearly listed, we will be making sure that the results can be replicated by performing cross-validation on the dataset before starting each run."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we found a dataset with Amazon reviews on women’s dresses. Here is some general information regarding the dataset:\n",
    "* 11 variables, 23.5 thousand observations\n",
    "* Each observation consists of the index (unique), age of the customer, division of the cloth the customer bought, department of the cloth, classification of the cloth, clothing ID (unique), title of the review text, the content of the review text, number of other customers who agree with the review, ratings in stars given to the product, and a binary recommendation index with 1 as YES and 0 as NO\n",
    "* Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/myntra-reviews-on-women-dresses-comprehensive\n",
    "Notice that the final size of the dataset that will be used may be different, since there are more data points than needed. In consideration for the overall runtime and memory usage, we may only use a chunk of the dataset. Additionally, not all variables will be used in our model. Our features will consist of analysis from the content of the review text and the age of the customer. With this being said, we will be dropping columns of the variables that are not needed for this model, and turning text-form data into usable information. While we are uncertain about the details of the transformation, some ideas that we have on it include making use of most frequently used words, cleaning out English stopwords, and stemming words with NLTK to avoid repetition of the same meaning of words."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform multi-class classification with logistic regression to classify categories of women’s dresses based on various features of the review dataset. Since there are multiple categories and departments of dresses and we wish to predict specific categories based on trends in customer reviews, it is appropriate to classify reviews into multiple classes rather than only 2 sets. The One vs. Rest approach will be utilized to perform multi-class classification. The reason for choosing One vs. Rest rather than the One vs. One approach is out of the concern that the One vs. One approach may be too computationally exhausting for our purposes due to the large number of categories we plan to classify. The number of classifiers required for the One vs. Rest approach is k (equal to the number of categories) whereas the One vs. One approach requires k(k-1)/2 classifiers to classify k categories. Since we expect to categorize the 23.5k reviews (likely less after we drop some of the less popular categories) into at least 5 different categories, it is more appropriate to use a One vs. Rest approach. As such, we chose logistic regression as the method of classification since logistic regression allows us to quantify confidence scores for the classification, which is used as a tiebreaker in the One vs. Rest approach of multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the main method of classification, we will be using various libraries and algorithms to prepare the data for classification. Specifically, we will be using the NLTK library to analyze the customer reviews. Since the reviews are bodies of text, NLTK provides useful tools for analyzing the contents of these reviews. Methods like nltk.corpus.stopwords.words(\"english\") and nltk.word_tokenize()allows us to transform our data into a form that is easier to work with while providing useful information about our dataset. NLTK also provides a built-in sentiment analyzer VADER, which is a very useful tool for analyzing the sentiments of the customer reviews. Efficiently and accurately dissecting the contents of the reviews is important for accurate classification."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use several metrics to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Confusion matrix will be a useful tool for us to easily visualize and understand the performance of classification. It is a convenient metric since it can be used not only for binary classification but also for multi-class classification. We will be able to generate an easily interpretable k x k grid, displaying true and false predictions. Furthermore, we will generate a ROC curve and calculate scores such as accuracy, f1 etc. in order to get a better idea of the trends in the performance of the classification in order to better modify the model."

    "We will be collecting data from Amazon reviews to build a recommender system for the clothing category. Since the data involved are already published online and made freely available on the Amazon website, we do not expect any ethical concerns with collecting our data. However, since there are names associated with Amazon reviews, a certain degree of anonymization will be necessary to ensure that no sensitive identifying information is included in our dataset and that no one’s privacy is placed at risk. The data collected will be stored in a secure database that is only accessible to authorized users. If data is no longer permissible for usage or no longer needed for the project, it will be removed from the database appropriately. It is also crucial for data to be examined objectively and transparently without bias. It should be noted that online shopping reviews are based on the customer’s self-reported experience with that product, so bias is inevitable in our dataset. Since this can affect the recommendations that the customer receives based on their self-reported experience with that product, it is important to make sure that results found from the data are based on reliable statistical techniques and have been collected in an unbiased manner. To account for proxy discrimination, we can make sure to include only user reviews where the customers have purchased the items themselves rather than receiving a free product to help ensure that our model is not relying on external biased variables. This project only aims to analyze the accuracy of recommendations to consumers based on their shopping experience, so we do not expect any unintended harm caused by our results. However, in case of any mishaps, we plan to address the issues by reworking our model and making any required updates to make sure it is producing the most accurate and unbiased results possible."
